# MY-AI-APP

**MY-AI-APP** is a Node.js application that leverages Google Generative AI's Gemini model to perform various tasks such as text generation, streaming responses, multi-model interactions, and more. The project includes multiple scripts that demonstrate different ways to interact with the Gemini model, allowing users to create, manage, and customize AI-driven tasks.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-ai-app.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd my-ai-app
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables**:

   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add your Google Generative AI API key:
   
     ```bash
     API_KEY=your-google-generative-ai-api-key
     ```

## Scripts

### 1. `gemini-chat.js`

   This script enables an interactive text-based chat session with the Gemini model. Users can type messages and receive responses from the model. The conversation continues until the user types 'exit'.

   **Usage**:
   ```bash
   node gemini-chat.js
   ```

### 2. `gemini-multi-model.js`

   Demonstrates interactions with multiple AI models, showing how to utilize different models in parallel or sequentially within the same script.

   **Usage**:
   ```bash
   node gemini-multi-model.js
   ```

### 3. `gemini-start.js`

   The main entry point for initializing and starting AI operations. It provides a basic framework to kickstart AI-driven processes.

   **Usage**:
   ```bash
   node gemini-start.js
   ```

### 4. `gemini-streaming.js`

   Allows streaming responses from the Gemini model. The model's output is streamed back to the user in real-time, providing a more dynamic interaction.

   **Usage**:
   ```bash
   node gemini-streaming.js
   ```

### 5. `gemini-text-to-text.js`

   Converts text input into generated text output using the Gemini model. It can be used for tasks such as content creation, summarization, or any other text-to-text generation.

   **Usage**:
   ```bash
   node gemini-text-to-text.js
   ```

## Usage

- Run any of the provided scripts using Node.js, ensuring that your API key is correctly set up in the `.env` file.
- Customize the scripts according to your specific use case by modifying the prompts, models, or additional configurations.
