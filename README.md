# MY-AI-APP

**MY-AI-APP** is a Node.js application that leverages Google Generative AI's Gemini model to perform various tasks such as text generation, streaming responses, multi-model interactions, and more. The project includes multiple scripts that demonstrate different ways to interact with the Gemini model, allowing users to create, manage, and customize AI-driven tasks.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-ai-app.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd my-ai-app
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables**:

   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add your Google Generative AI API key:
   
     ```bash
     API_KEY=your-google-generative-ai-api-key
     ```

## Scripts

### 1. `gemini-chat.js`

   Facilitates an interactive chat with the Gemini-1.5-Flash model. It loads API configurations, handles user input, and displays AI responses in the console. The chat session continues until 'exit' is entered.

   **Usage**:
   ```bash
   node gemini-chat.js
   ```

### 2. `gemini-multi-model.js`

   Utilizes the Google Generative AI API to generate text from provided images. It initializes the API client with your key, converts images for the Gemini-1.5-Flash model, and logs the generated text to the console.

   **Usage**:
   ```bash
   node gemini-multi-model.js
   ```

### 3. `gemini-start.js`

   The main entry point for initializing and starting AI operations. It provides a basic framework to kickstart AI-driven processes.

   **Usage**:
   ```bash
   node gemini-start.js
   ```

### 4. `gemini-streaming.js`

   Enables real-time text-based chat with the Gemini-1.5-Flash model. It initializes the AI client, uses readline for user input, and streams AI responses live. The chat continues until 'exit' is typed.

   **Usage**:
   ```bash
   node gemini-streaming.js
   ```

### 5. `gemini-text-to-text.js`

   Uses the Google Generative AI API to create a rhyming sonnet about a programmer's life. It initializes the client with your API key, uses the "gemini-1.5-flash" model, and logs the generated sonnet to the console.

   **Usage**:
   ```bash
   node gemini-text-to-text.js
   ```

## Usage

- Run any of the provided scripts using Node.js, ensuring that your API key is correctly set up in the `.env` file.
- Customize the scripts according to your specific use case by modifying the prompts, models, or additional configurations.
